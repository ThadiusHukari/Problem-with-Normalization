# Problem-with-Normalization
Thadius Hukari ITC102 W16 - HW5  Cons of Normalization:  The first problem with Normalization is that you canâ€™t start building the DB before you know what the user needs. Normalization is a structured system that that needs maintenance and can be costly. Next, speed and site performance can take a hit due to lot of Joins. A highly normalized DB structure will need a larger amount of joins to retrieve the records the application needs to function. This is most apparent when many users are accessing the DB at the same time. This can create a bottleneck situation. This creates more work because then your application designers will need to denormalize the DB design in order to optimize performance requirements.
